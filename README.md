# Cat Image Gallery

This is a simple image gallery showcasing adorable pictures of my cat. The gallery is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Features

- Responsive layout: The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a pleasant viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Descriptive alt text: Each image is accompanied by a descriptive alt text, making it accessible for users who rely on screen readers or have images disabled.

## Usage
